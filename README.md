I used oop and turtle library to create this project.The file main.py makes use of other classes and their functions to create the game.The turtle has to cross the path without touching the cars.
I created the class "Player" to make the turtle.it handles the movement and speed of the turtle. 
I created another class "car_manager" to create rectangle  shaped turtles that represent the car.This class contains funcions that deal with levels and car movement.
The class "scoreboard" is used to update the score and display  it on the screen.
Latly,the main function makes object of each other class and uses the objects to call the functions accordingly.
